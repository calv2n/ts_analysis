## Motivation

A comparison between XGBoost and AutoRegression in future predictions

## Dataset

PMJ Interconnection LLC (PMJ) is a regional transmission organization (RTO) operating an electric transmission system serving all or part of many states in the Eastern United States. It is considered the the largest independent power grid operator in North America [@pv2025pjm].

The dataset we will use in our analysis contains the hourly and daily power consumption data from PJM. The dataset spans 2002 to 2018 and contains 145,336 hourly and 6,057 daily records. [@wqg6-9917-25]


```{python}
#| include: true
from statsmodels.tsa.ar_model import AutoReg
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import xgboost as xgb

# energy_df = pd.read_csv('data/PJME_hourly.csv')
# energy_df['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(energy_df['Datetime'])
# energy = energy_df['PJME_MW']
# sns.lineplot(energy_df, x='Datetime', y='PJME_MW')
```
